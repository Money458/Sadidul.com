                To make a website, you need three main languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to create the structure and content of the website, like headings, paragraphs, images, and buttons. CSS is used to style the website by changing colors, fonts, layouts, and designs to make the website look beautiful. JavaScript is used to add interactive features like clicking a button, showing messages, or changing content without reloading the page. First, you create an HTML file to write the content, then you link a CSS file to design it, and finally, you add a JavaScript file to make it interactive. When you open the HTML file in a browser, the website will appear with all the structure, design, and functionality combined.
